I am working on a beverage search web application built with React and Tailwind CSS.

I want you to perform a complete UI/UX improvement while strictly following these rules:

🔒 Mandatory Rules (DO NOT BREAK)

DO NOT change any existing functionality

DO NOT modify business logic, state management, hooks, services, or API calls

DO NOT rename props, functions, or variables

DO NOT remove or add new logic

Only update styling, layout, typography, spacing, colors, and animations

🎨 Design Goals

Create a modern, elegant, and professional UI

Improve readability and visual hierarchy

Use a soft, eye-friendly design (avoid harsh contrasts)

Keep the current color palette, but refine and harmonize it

Apply subtle glassmorphism or soft card styles where appropriate

Improve modal design (smooth transitions, better spacing, clear focus)

Improve card components (depth, hover states, smooth animations)

Ensure fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)

🔤 Typography

Improve font usage (modern, clean, readable)

Use proper font scale (headings vs body text)

Avoid overly decorative fonts

✨ Animations & Interactions

Use subtle animations only (hover, focus, modal open/close)

Prefer CSS or Tailwind transitions

Animations must feel smooth and professional, not distracting

🧩 Technical Constraints

Use Tailwind CSS utilities whenever possible

If a library is absolutely necessary (e.g., animations), explain why before using it

Do not introduce breaking changes

📦 Output Expectations

Update component styles incrementally

Provide clean, readable Tailwind classes

Keep components reusable and consistent

If you change styles globally, explain what was changed and why

Start by improving:

Global layout and typography

Beverage cards

Modal design

Responsiveness and spacing

Proceed carefully and validate that functionality remains unchanged after every UI improvement.

💡 Tips to use this prompt effectively

Pégalo antes de mostrar tu código

Luego di:

“Apply the UI improvements to this component without changing functionality”

Si usas Copilot Chat, ejecútalo archivo por archivo

Si algo no te gusta, di:

“Refine this UI further, keep it subtle and more minimal”
